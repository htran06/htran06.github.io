My special repo
For asignment 1:
I used Phoenix Wright as my identity, while keeping my name, most of the information is made up.

I had way too many problems with the lab, since I continuously encountered the fatal error
whenever I tried to push using the MobaX terminal. Moreover, the assignment was somehow unclear
about how to use Git (or GitHub) which confused me a huge deal.
The html and css part was managable and I found them interesting and clear (unlinke the Git part).
I hope there will be better instruction for the lab in the future (what kind of terminal to use, 
basics on how Git works with directories, what program can students use ...)   

I have asked a few questions to a friend who majors in CS about Git and Github, but he was not directly
involve in any part of the assignment.

I spent approximately 4 hours on the Github lab and this assignment, mostly frustrated and agitated.
