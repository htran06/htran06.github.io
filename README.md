My special repo
For asignment 1:
I used Phoenix Wright as my identity, while keeping my name, most of the information is made up.
I have asked a few questions to a friend who majors in CS about github, but he was not directly
involve in any part of the assignment.
I spent approximately 4 hours on the Github lab and this assignment, mostly frustrated and agitated.
