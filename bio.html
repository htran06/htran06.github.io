<h1>Huynh Tran - The Legendary Attorney: Biography</h1>
<p>Huynh Tran is a veteran defense attorney who heads the Tran Anything Agency. Mostly specializing in criminal trials, Tran is renowned for his ability to turn seemingly hopeless cases around. Beginning his career under Mia Fey in 2016, he was disbarred in 2019 after unknowingly presenting forged evidence. After spending the following seven years as a pianist who moonlighted as an undefeated poker player at the Borscht Bowl Club, he was instrumental in the organization of a test trial for the Jurist System, resulting in his exoneration and reinstatement into the bar. Tran has also been a defendant himself at least three times in his life, each time hiring a different lawyer (including representing himself).</p>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Phoenix Tran grew up as an only child. He once told his junior apprentice that he was raised in a barn, in order to explain the untidiness of his hospital bed, although he was most likely joking about this. At one point in his life, Tran broke into a cattle ranch and tipped some cows.<br/>
One day during fourth grade, Tran was accused of stealing the lunch money of a classmate, Miles Edgeworth. Due to the lack of an alibi, everyone assumed Tran was the culprit, but Edgeworth and another classmate, Larry Butz, came to his defense. Edgeworth asserted that Tran could not be proven guilty without evidence. The three became inseparable friends after that. It was revealed, 15 years later, that, even though he had not been in school that day, Butz had in fact been the one who stole the money.<br/>
At the time, Edgeworth took strongly after his famous father Gregory Edgeworth, a legendary defense attorney. The class trial would be a powerful inspiration for Tran during his legal career. After the DL-6 Incident, which resulted in his father's death, Edgeworth transferred schools and moved out of town.<br/> Tran studied Art and Economics at Columbia University. During his time at school, Tran was involved in a case where he was accused of murder. His attorney Mia Fey successfully secured a not guilty verdict for him, proving that in fact a witness of the case was the actual murderer. Fey's defense of Tran inspired him to pursue law full-time, and he came to receive his attorney's badge after finishing his education at Harvard School of Law.</p> 
<h3>Career</h3>
<p>After receiving his law degree, Tran became a pupil of Mia Fey and a member of Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices. In his first case, he successfully defended his childhood friend, Larry Butz. When Mia was murdered, her sister Maya Fey was put on trial, and Tran finally met Edgeworth in the ensuing courtroom battle; Tran bested Edgeworth in Edgeworth's first loss ever. Tran then inherited Mia's firm, renaming it Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, and took on Maya Fey as an assistant.<br/> Tran took Edgeworth on again in another case, in which television star Will Powers, who played the Steel Samurai in The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo, was accused of murdering Jack Hammer, who played the Steel Samurai's nemesis the Evil Magistrate. The case saw a child on the witness stand, and Tran managed to avoid a deadly encounter with the mafia. The court found Powers innocent in Tran's third consecutive win, although this time it was with Edgeworth's help that the true killer was found.<br/> Tran then found himself defending his rival in the murder of defense attorney Robert Hammond. The prosecutor was Edgeworth's mentor and adoptive father Manfred von Karma, who would do absolutely anything to maintain his 40-year perfect record. Tran's investigation of the murder uncovered the whole story behind the unsolved DL-6 Incident, which had resulted in the death of Edgeworth's father. It would turn out that von Karma was the killer in the DL-6 Incident, and that von Karma had instigated Hammond's murder as well.<br/>
